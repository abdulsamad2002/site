&lt;p&gt;Mr Robot CTF is a medium level linux based machine offered by TryHackMe. We have to find the keys inorder to complete this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enumeration&#34;&gt;Enumeration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;nmap-scan&#34;&gt;Nmap Scan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of we start with scanning the target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nmap -sT -T4 -p- -sV 10.10.134.174
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nmap results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nmap scan report for 10.10.134.174
Host is up (0.17s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd

Service detection performed. 
Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 352.56 seconds
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a 2 open ports both of them have a webserver running one has SSL/HTTP at port 443 and the other is HTTP at port 80.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h3>
<h4 id="nmap-scan">Nmap Scan</h4>
<p>First of we start with scanning the target</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo nmap -sT -T4 -p- -sV 10.10.134.174
</code></pre><p>Nmap results:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Nmap scan report for 10.10.134.174

</code></pre><p>We have a 2 open ports both of them have a webserver running one has SSL/HTTP at port 443 and the other is HTTP at port 80.</p>
<p>Opening the web app in the browser provides us with an interesting interface in which we aren&rsquo;t interested.</p>
<p>Examining the webapp for common directories I stumbled across the <code>/robots.txt</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>Content of which were as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
</code></pre><p>For the first key we have the end point <code>/key-1-of-3.txt</code>.</p>
<p>We also found the <code>/fsocity.dic</code> endpoint which has a wordlist which might come in handy later.</p>
<h4 id="directory-busting">Directory Busting</h4>
<p>Now moving on, we need to do directory busting to find new endpoints, we employ DirBuster for this task:</p>
<p><img src="/media/dirb.png" alt="DirBuster"></p>
<p>This yields us some really interesting results:
<code>/license</code>
<code>/login</code></p>
<p>Visiting the <code>/license</code> endpoint we get:</p>
<p><img src="/media/license.png" alt="/license"></p>
<p>Scrolling further down we are greeted with a base64 string which screams &ldquo;password&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/media/string.png" alt="/license"></p>
<p>After decoding the base64 string we found we get not only the password but also the username which quite matches the theme of this box:
User: <code>Elliot</code>
Password: <code>ER28-0652</code></p>
<p>Now equipped with user and password we move on to the <code>/login</code> endpoint.</p>
<p><img src="/media/login.png" alt="login"></p>
<p>We login with the credentials we have and we get a wordpress dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="/media/dash.png" alt="dashboard"></p>
<h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3>
<p>Poking around I found the theme editorhiding in plainsight, this bad boy could be our way in.</p>
<p><img src="/media/404.png" alt="editor"></p>
<p>Now we have access to some code that can be manipulated and used to gain a reverse shell on the target, what we need to do is replace the code for 404.php with a reverse shell.</p>
<p>Before we execute the reverse shell file on the target we need to setup a listener on our host.
For that we have netcat.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>rlwrap nc -lvnp 1234
</code></pre><p>Using rlwrap is not necessary but it&rsquo;s the quality of life stuff. Now we have our listener up and running.</p>
<p><img src="/media/nc.png" alt="listener"></p>
<p>Executing our reverse shell by visiting the URL: <code>http://10.10.134.174/wp-includes/themes/TwentyFifteen/404.php</code></p>
<p>We get a shell.</p>
<p><img src="/media/shell.png" alt="shell"></p>
<p>We land as daemon which is not privileged enough to access the &ldquo;key&rdquo; file so we need to change to a system user which in this case is &ldquo;robot&rdquo; it&rsquo;s password is given in a md5 hash.</p>
<p>We crack the hash using John the Ripper and the fsocity.dic wordlist we found earlier, now we have the password: <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code></p>
<p>Now inorder to change the user we need to have an interactive shell which right now we don&rsquo;t, so to make the current shell interactive we simply use:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python -c &#39;import pty;pty.spawn(&#34;/bin/bash&#34;)&#39;
</code></pre><p>And we have an interactive shell</p>
<p><img src="/media/key2.png" alt="shell"></p>
<p>Now we can easily obtain the second key.</p>
